# Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting which customers are likely to discontinue using a company’s services based on demographic, usage, and account data.  
This project uses the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset to build and evaluate a Machine Learning model.

---

## Project Overview
Customer churn is when a customer stops doing business with a company. Early prediction allows businesses to proactively retain customers.

In this project, I:
- Imported and explored the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data for improved accuracy.
- Built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict churn.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Visualized churn trends and feature importance.

## Dataset
- Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)  
- Number of records: ~7,000  
- Features: Customer demographics, account info, service details  
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No classification)

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:


3. Upload the dataset (`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) in the Colab notebook or place it in the same folder for Jupyter.

4. Run the notebook cell-by-cell to reproduce the results.

## Results

- Model Accuracy: **X%**  *(Replace 'X' with your obtained accuracy score)*  
- Key features impacting churn: Contract type, tenure, monthly charges, internet service type.

---

## Visualizations

- Churn count plot  
- Confusion matrix heatmap  
- Monthly charges distribution by churn

---

## Future Work

- Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost for better accuracy.  
- Feature engineering to create meaningful new variables.  
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask for interactive use.
